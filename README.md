# My Movies

This website is served by a static array of movies and list them based on my Letterboxd review.


## Future improvements

I'm not satisfied with the current state of this project, I would love to have it served by live data, but unfortuntately the Letterboxd API is closed.

That's why my idea is to fetch the Letterbox's RSS feed and use it to display data.
